K-12,,,,"Let's start with my background. I'm from a working class, non-academic family. Being labeled a ""dumb kid"" by my 5th grade teacher would limit my academic choices until my 7th grade math teacher moved me into pre-algebra… with 6 weeks left in the school year. I did the bulk of pre-algebra in 6 weeks. This is when I learned that I can do hard things. In fact, <b>I like overcoming challenges</b>.",17,numbered,blue,"Camarillo, CA",34.224456,-119.036286,,,,
UCLA,,,,"I found my way to working several jobs in UCLA's Office of Residential Life, first in an office job, then in two leadership roles in dorm life. Late nights, school work, team work, and quite literally saving lives, I learned that <b>growth happens outside of my comfort zone.</b>",17,numbered,blue,UCLA,34.070137,-118.44442,,,,

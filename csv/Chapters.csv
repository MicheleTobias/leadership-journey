<p>In junior high, something shifted in my brain and I suddenly saw math as a creative subject. Solving problems requires creativity.</p> <p>My 7th grade math teacher saw the impact of this and moved me into pre-algebra with 6 weeks left in the school year. It opened the door to honors and AP classes in high school and eventually a PhD.</p><br><p>Making it through all of pre-algebra in 6 weeks is when I learned that I can do hard things if I build on the foundations of my personality instead of trying to be someone else.</p> <br><lesson>Forget about the judgment.

<p>At UC Davis Library and DataLab, I've learned to stop asking permission. At least, I don't ask permission to start something I think is important. Instead, I build a proof-of-concept of whatever it is I want to do. Having a tangible example and a plan is often easier for people to understand and trust. For example, the <a href=""https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/ava"">AVA Digitizing Project</a> has a rough start because there were so many people who could say no to getting started. Having a small sample dataset helped but the impact wasn't immediately apparent. For my <a href=""https://datalab-dev.github.io/covid_worksite_exposure/"">Potential COVID Exposures campus map</a>, I didn't even tell anyone about the idea. I spent a few hours building a simple example (with tech we didn't even end up using for the big project) and showed it to the lab. It was an ugly animation of data changing over time that needed a lot more work, but because they could see it, I got a greenlight to spend more time on it. </p><br><lesson>You don't need permission to lead, but sometimes a little proof or plan goes a long way in building trust.</lesson>",15,numbered,blue,UC Davis,38.539558,-121.749954,,,,

<p>My journey, taken one piece at a time, seems pretty random. I'm not even telling you about some of it, like why I know how to use a kite to build 3D data models of terrain or how I found myself giving a presentation at a conference to 200 people when I thought I'd have 30 or why I've snorkeled in urban streams in Los Angeles for work. Yours might feel like that too. But the one thing I know is that all of these random interests eventually have a use. They build skills that you'll use in the future and you'll be glad you did it.</p><br><lesson>Time spent doing interesting things is never wasted, even if you don't know how it fits the bigger picture yet.</lesson><br><p> So follow your creative impulses. It will lead you to places you never thought you'd go.</p>",4,hidden,,,,,,,,

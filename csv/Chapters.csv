,media/Star_Marker.png,,,"<h1>Being a Creative isn't Easy.</h1><p>Uniqueness often isn't <b>valued</b> because it challenges the status quo and can make a person feel unpredictable.</p><p>I'm an incredibly creative person working at the intersections of data science and geospatial technologies inside an academic library. That collision of art, science, computer science, and formality is often at odds. This is how I got to where I am and how I keep going.</p>",8,hidden,,UC Davis,38.539558,-121.749954,,,,
Early Days,media/Candy.png,,,"<p>Creative kids are often viewed as ""bad"", ""unfocused"", ""off topic"".</p><p>In junior high, something shifted in my brain and I suddenly saw math as a creative subject. Solving problems requires creativity.</p> <p>My 7th grade math teacher saw the impact of this and moved me into pre-algebra with 6 weeks left in the school year. It opend the door to honors and AP classes in high school and eventually a PhD.</p><br><p>Making it through all of pre-algebra in 6 weeks is when I learned that I can do hard things if I build on the foundations of my personality instead of trying to be someone else.</p> <br><lesson>Forget about the judegement. Use your strengths.</lesson>.",14,numbered,blue,"Camarillo, CA",34.224456,-119.036286,,,,
UCLA - Office of Residential Life,media/Cloud_Smile.png,,,"<p>I found my way to working several jobs in UCLA's Office of Residential Life, first in an office job, then in two leadership roles in dorm life. Late nights, school work, team work, and quite literally saving lives, I learned that</p><br><lesson>growth happens outside of my comfort zone.</lesson><br><p>But I also found a supportive community where for the first time I experienced a depth of diversity I'd never seen before. I was weird, but so was everyone else.</p><br><lesson>Don't underestimate the power of support from your peers.</lesson>",14,numbered,blue,UCLA,34.070137,-118.44442,,,,
University of Michigan - Endangered Species UPDATE,media/Rainbow.png,,,"<p>I took the role of editor-in-chief of an academic journal focused on endangered species that didn't have a lot of resources. With my co-editor-in-chief, we rebuilt a small staff, revived lapsed donations, and brought in new articles.</p><br><p>I gained an inside view of the academic journal industry and expanded my academic network.</p><br><lesson>Actively seek out jobs or projects that will fill gaps in your skillset.</lesson>",14,numbered,blue,University of Michigan,42.277313,-83.737194,,,,
UC Davis - Library & DataLab,media/ShootingStar.png,,,"<p>At UC Davis Library and DataLab, I've learned to stop asking permission. At least, I don't ask permission to start something I think is important. Instead, I build a proof-of-concept of whatever it is I want to do. Having a tangible example and a plan is often easier for people to understand and trust. For example, the AVA Digitizing Project has a rough start because there were so many people who could say no to getting started. Having a small sample dataset helped but the impact wasn't immediately apparent. For my Potential COVID Exposures campus map, I didn't even tell anyone about the idea. I spent a few hours building a simple example (with tech we didn't even end up using for the big project) and showed it to the lab. It was an ugly animation of data changing over time that needed a lot more work, but because they could see it, I got a greenlight to spend more time on it. </p><br><lesson>You don't need permission to lead, but sometimes a little proof or plan goes a long way in buiding trust.</lesson>",14,numbered,blue,UC Davis,38.539558,-121.749954,,,,
It All Comes Together,media/Unicorn.png,,,"<p>My journey, taken one piece at a time, seems pretty random. I'm not even telling you about some of it, like why I know how to use a kite to build 3D data models of terrain or how I found myself giving a presentation at a conference to 200 people when I thought I'd have 30 or why I've snorkled in urban streams in Los Angeles for work. Yours might feel like that too. But the one thing I know is that all of these random interests eventually have a use. They build skills that you'll use in the future and you'll be glad you did it.</p><br><lesson>Time spent doing interesting things is never wasted, even if you don't know how it fits the bigger picture yet.</lesson><br><p> So follow your creative impulses. It will lead you to places you never thought you'd go.</p>",8,hidden,,UC Davis,38.539558,-121.749954,,,,

Early Education,media/ShootingStar.png,,,"<p>Creative kids are often viewed as ""bad"", ""unfocused"", ""off topic"".</p><p>In junior high, something shifted in my brain and I suddenly saw math as a creative subject.

I was weird, but so was everyone else.</p>",14,numbered,blue,UCLA,34.070137,-118.44442,,,,
University of Michigan - Endangered Species UPDATE,,,,"<p>I took the role of editor-in-chief of an academic journal focused on endangered species that didn't have a lot of resources.

UC Davis - Library & DataLab,,,,"<p>At UC Davis Library and DataLab, by building some pretty cool tools and datsets I've learned to stop asking permission. </p><br><lesson>You don't need permission to lead.</lesson><p>Just do it. Make a proof of concept first if you really do need permission so people know what you're talking about.</p>",14,numbered,blue,UC Davis,38.539558,-121.749954,,,,
